# Arduino-Security-System
Initially, the alarm is passive. When the user presses the button, the alarm is armed after a 10-second delay. If the sensor detects movement while the alarm is active, the user has 10 seconds to scan the correct card. If the correct card is scanned, the alarm deactivates; otherwise, the buzzer will start beeping.
